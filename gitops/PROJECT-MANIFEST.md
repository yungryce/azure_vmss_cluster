# Project Manifest: GitOps Continuous Delivery

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Kubernetes GitOps Configuration
- **Type**: Declarative Configuration
- **Scope**: Application Deployment and Orchestration
- **Status**: Production-Ready

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Flux CD 2.0
- **Platform**: Kubernetes 1.24+
- **Source Control Integration**: Git-based operations
- **Repository Structure**: Kustomize-compatible layout
- **Security Features**: SOPS encryption, RBAC definitions, Network Policies

## Demonstrated Competencies
- GitOps Workflow Implementation
- Kubernetes Manifest Management
- Progressive Delivery
- Configuration Layering
- Drift Detection and Reconciliation
- Infrastructure as Code
- Environment Promotion
- Secret Management
- Policy Enforcement
- Automated Reconciliation

## System Context
This component functions as the definitive source of truth for the Kubernetes cluster state. After Ansible establishes the Kubernetes cluster and Flux CD, this GitOps repository drives all subsequent deployments and configuration changes through Git workflows rather than direct cluster access.

## Deployment Requirements
- Existing Kubernetes cluster with Flux CD installed
- Git repository accessible to Flux controllers
- SSH keys or tokens for repository access
- SOPS integration for secret management (optional)

## Development Workflow
1. Local manifest development using Kustomize
2. PR-based reviews for configuration changes
3. Automated validation in CI pipeline
4. Merge to target environment branch
5. Automated reconciliation by Flux CD

## Maintenance Notes
- All cluster changes should follow GitOps principles
- Manifests use Kustomize for environment overlays
- Secrets require encryption before commitment
- Namespace isolation enforces multi-team boundaries
- Health checks ensure application availability
